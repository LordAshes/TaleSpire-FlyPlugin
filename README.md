# Fly Plugin

This unofficial TaleSpire plugin allows both the player and GM to toggle the fly mode. In core TS only the GM can toggle
the fly more on any mini. This plugin adds a PC fly to the menu which remains an option even when the user is a player.

## Change Log

1.1.0: Added optional removal of the original GM only hide (since GM can use the new version too). Default is hidden.
       Can be turned back in the R2ModMan configuration for this plugin.
       
1.1.0: New fly option only appears to GM and the owner. Other players don't have access to the new fly mode.

1.0.0: Initial release

## Install

Use R2ModMan or similar installer to install this plugin.

## Usage

Select the new fly icon to toggle fly more just like the orignal.

## Limitation

The original fly version and PC fly version don't sync so when fly is activated with one, it should be turned off with
the same one. In general the old fly should not be used anymore since the GM can also use the PC fly, hence why the
default for hiding the original option is true.
